                        With "Timecoder" you can document in/out sequences of a video.
                        When specifying an in and out timecode, "Timecoder" will calculate the difference between the
                        two.
                        You are also able to add a comment to a in/out sequence.
                        <LargeBr/>
                        You can export and share your sequences via a .csv table or a link.

                        If you are a video producer, your client can document desired corrections with this web
                        application
                        and send you back a link so you can implement these corrections.
                        <LargeBr/>
                        This application uses Next.js with React and TypeScript.

                            A in/out sequence consists of an in and out timecode,
                            a difference timecode and a comment field. The in-timecode specifies the
                            beginning of the sequence via a timecode
                            (example: <Code>00:01:15:14</Code>).
                            <LargeBr/>
                            The out-timecode specifies the end the sequence also via a timecode
                            (example: <Code>00:02:01:21</Code>).
                            <LargeBr/>
                            Timecoder automatically calculates the difference between the in and the out
                            timecode and displays the result in the difference timecode
                            (example: <Code>00:00:46:07</Code>).
                            <LargeBr/>
                            You are able to comment the sequence, for example to state some corrections
                            in that time frame (example: <Highlight>Please add a caption here with text:
                            "Our company is proud to announce the opening of its second factory in Berlin."</Highlight>).
                            <LargeBr/>
                            You can also delete sequences and change the arrangement by swapping them.
